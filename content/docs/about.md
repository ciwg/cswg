## Background

The Community Systems Working Group (CSWG) is focused on
development of open-source infrastructure for operations and
governance of communities, organizations, schools, and workplaces,
with [NOMCON](https://nomcon.org), [Nation of
Makers](https://www.nationofmakers.us/), the Maker community, and our
shared physical and virtual spaces as reference implementations.

We launched the CSWG at the end of NOMCON 2022.  The conference relied
on nearly a dozen third-party services, thousands of lines of custom
Python and Go code, and hundreds of hours of volunteer and staff time
to fill in the gaps between and outside those systems.  

See the [data flow diagram](/docs/nomcon-2022/dataflow) -- we've
managed to make these events work, but existing and third-party
systems are not really up to the task, leading to a lot of extra time
spent filling in the gaps and dealing with exceptions, both ahead of
time and in-run.

This high-friction environment impacts decision-making and progress
before, during, and after these events and leads to burnout and a loss
off momentum throughout their related communities year-round.  Given
that many of these communities are on the forefront of human
creativity and innovation, it's reasonable to expect that this loss of
effectiveness is impacting society as a whole.

## Goals and Methods

While we can't yet know global conditions at the time of NOMCON 2023,
for instance, we do know that we may be called upon to host a hybrid
conference with both in-person and virtual access in order to
include those who would otherwise be marginalized.  

Hybrid is harder than virtual, and harder than in-person.

In this working group, we'll refer to some existing communities that
demonstrate the seeds of the innovations needed.  We'll document the
infrastructure we have so far, and put together a roadmap for the next
five years, including preparations for NOMCON 2023, support for our
own spaces and organizations, and better infrastructure for working
groups right now.

We need this -- not only for our communities and organizations, but
also for better work/life balance as well as economic and supply chain
health.  We need this in order to encourage a healthy, vibrant social
ecosystem in a far-flung, networked world.  We need this in support of
the new renaissance era that will ultimately be required to resolve
the multiple crises now facing our species and planet.

## About Us
CSWG is a maker collective focused on building open-source infrastructure for organizing and managing decentralized organizations & communities. This includes makerspaces, non-profits, open-source projects, and other groups that largely rely on volunteers and community support.

## Goals
Our goal is to eliminate as much of the administrative overhead as possible for organizing community efforts, so that the people involved can focus on the work they're passionate about.

We've identified a number of areas where we can make a difference:
- Reducing reliance on third-party services and tools
- Avoiding siloes of data caused by limitations of traditional infrastructure
- Decreasing dependency on a few individuals to keep things running, causing burnout

Our projects are focused on building tools and systems that address these needs.

## Projects
- The [PromiseGrid](https://github.com/promisegrid/promisegrid) and [Grokker](https://github.com/stevegt/grokker) projects are where we're focusing efforts right now.

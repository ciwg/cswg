## About Us
CSWG is focused on building open-source infrastructure for decentralized organizations & communities, including makerspaces, non-profits, open-source projects, and other small and medium enterprises who are looking for better ways of managing their shared resources.

## Goals
Our goal is to reduce the workload and increase the resiliency of community and organizational infrastructure so the people involved can focus on the work they're passionate about.

We've identified a number of closely-related areas where we believe we can make a difference:

- Avoiding up-front cost of traditional infrastructure buildout.
- Reducing reliance on centralized third-party services and tools and
  the lock-in that comes with them.
- Avoiding fragility, operational and change management workload, and siloes of data caused by [fundamental limitations](http://www.infrastructures.org/papers/turing/turing.html) inherent in traditional computing infrastructure management practices.
- Decreasing the bottlenecks and burnout of key individuals that are common in hierarchical organizations.

## Projects

<p>The Community Systems Working Group (CSWG) began its focus on
development of open-source infrastructure for operations and
governance of communities, organizations, schools, and workplaces,
with <a href="https://nomcon.org">NOMCON</a>, <a href="https://www.nationofmakers.us/">Nation of
Makers</a>, the Maker community, and our
shared physical and virtual spaces as reference implementations.</p>
<p>We launched the CSWG at the end of NOMCON 2022.  The conference relied
on nearly a dozen third-party services, thousands of lines of custom
Python and Go code, and hundreds of hours of volunteer and staff time
to fill in the gaps between and outside those systems.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/docs/nomcon-2022/dataflow">data flow diagram</a> &ndash; we&rsquo;ve
managed to make these events work, but existing and third-party
systems are not really up to the task, leading to a lot of extra time
spent filling in the gaps and dealing with exceptions, both ahead of
time and in-run.</p>
<p>This high-friction environment impacts decision-making and progress
before, during, and after these events and leads to burnout and a loss
off momentum throughout their related communities year-round.  Given
that many of these communities are on the forefront of human
creativity and innovation, it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect that this loss of
effectiveness is impacting society as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="goals-and-methods">
  Goals and Methods
  <a class="anchor" href="#goals-and-methods">#</a>
</h2>
<p>While we can&rsquo;t yet know global conditions at the time of NOMCON 2023,
for instance, we do know that we may be called upon to host a hybrid
conference with both in-person and virtual access in order to
include those who would otherwise be marginalized.</p>
<p>Hybrid is harder than virtual, and harder than in-person.</p>
<p>In this working group, we&rsquo;ll refer to some existing communities that
demonstrate the seeds of the innovations needed.  We&rsquo;ll document the
infrastructure we have so far, and put together a roadmap for the next
five years, including preparations for NOMCON 2023, support for our
own spaces and organizations, and better infrastructure for working
groups right now.</p>
<p>We need this &ndash; not only for our communities and organizations, but
also for better work/life balance as well as economic and supply chain
health.  We need this in order to encourage a healthy, vibrant social
ecosystem in a far-flung, networked world.  We need this in support of
the new renaissance era that will ultimately be required to resolve
the multiple crises now facing our species and planet.</p>
